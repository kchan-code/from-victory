// Wing × I miss the free throws
//
// Psychological center: confidence / withdrawal. Fouled on a jumper, both free
// throws rim out — the quietest, most exposed miss in the gym. The false story
// "even my free shot won't fall" generalizes one stripe to the whole stroke and
// pulls the Wing into hiding. Tactical beat resolves toward staying aggressive:
// keep attacking, keep getting to the line, knock the next ones down. FV-29 §4
// (Wing grid, missed-fts). Reset beat and faith clips reused verbatim.
