// Goalie × I miss a scoring chance
//
// Goalie 'missed chance' reframed — fanning on a poke check, missing an empty-net look, or not moving the puck on a chance. The false story is 'I cost us a goal.'
//
// One of the 30-cell pregame audio matrix (3 positions × 10 adversities).
// Generated 2026-05-27 from the locked Forward + Defense + Goalie pilot
// templates. Segments 1-3 and 8-9 are universal lift; segments 4-6 are
// position-specific lift from the goalie pilot; segment 7 is
// cell-specific.
//
// Instruction blocks now import from the shared ./instructions.ts module.
// Position segments 4-6 are still lifted from the position pilot — a future
// extraction to per-position segment modules.
