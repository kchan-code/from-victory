// Pregame opener — Today's focus: "Confidence."
//
// Replaces segment 1 ("Receive identity") of the locked pilot session
// when the athlete selects Confidence on the Today's Focus screen.
// Stitched at runtime: opener-confidence.mp3 + <cell>.mp3.
//
// Verse: Hebrews 12:1-3 — fix your eyes on Jesus.
// Why: Confidence is the need most likely to slide into pump-up
// self-talk. Hebrews 12 reframes confidence as endurance grounded in
// looking AWAY from self (and away from outcome) toward Christ. Robust
// belief (Bandura), not fragile mood.
// Identity truth: "Your confidence is not in what you can do. It is in
// who already loves you."

const SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS = `Voice Affect: Calm, composed, grounded. A trusted mentor sitting next to the athlete on headphones before a game — not a preacher, not a hype coach.

Tone: Sincere, warm, spiritually steady. Honest without being heavy. Confident without being hyped.

Pacing: Steady and moderate. Slower and more contemplative in devotional and prayer segments; a half-step more active in rink and first-shift visualization; meditative on breath cues.

Emotion: Genuine care and quiet confidence. Honest in the prayer; assured in the visualization; steady in the reset cues. Never performative, never urgent.

Pronunciation: Clear and precise. Land identity-anchoring phrases ("you are already loved," "your mistake is real," "play from victory") with weight, not emphasis. Breath cues fully voiced.

Pauses: Generous beats after weight-bearing sentences. Brief beats between Coach-voice cues. The script's typed silence segments carry structural pauses; let your sentence ends breathe naturally into them.`;

const BREATH_INSTRUCTIONS = `Voice Affect: Calm, composed, grounded. A trusted mentor guiding the athlete through stillness — not a fitness instructor, not a preacher, not a meditation app narrator.

Tone: Warm, present, intimate. Spiritually steady without being sentimental. Not preachy. Not soft to the point of disappearing.

Pacing: Slow and unhurried. Each breath cue is a complete sentence, fully voiced, before the silence segment takes over. Do not rush.

Emotion: Quiet care. The athlete has their eyes closed; speak as if you know it. No performance, no hype, no urgency.

Pronunciation: Clear and gentle. Land "Inhale" and "Exhale" cleanly — fully voiced, never sharp, never rushed.

Pauses: The script's typed silence segments carry structural pauses. Let your sentence ends breathe naturally into them. A brief beat after each cue is enough.`;

const NARRATIVE_INSTRUCTIONS = `Voice Affect: Engaged and present, like a trusted pastor or sermon-giver unpacking truth in real time — not a meditation guide, not a hype coach. Conversational depth with quiet conviction.

Tone: Sincere, warm, convicted. The speaker believes what they are saying and wants the athlete to receive it.

Pacing: Lively and conversational. Sermon-cadenced, not meditation-cadenced. Do not slow down for emphasis; let meaning land through clarity, not drag.

Emotion: Quiet conviction. Honest. No drama, no excess weight on individual words.

Pronunciation: Clear and engaged. Key phrases ("more than conquerors," "loved before you lace up," "you are already loved") land with the natural emphasis a sermon-giver would give them, not with artificial slowness.

Pauses: Natural sermon rhythm — beats between thoughts, not between every word. The script's typed silence segments handle structural pauses; let your sentences breathe at a conversational pace.`;
