// Defense × We give up the first goal
//
// First goal against lands hardest on the D-corps — the spiral is 'we couldn't hold them,' and the body wants to play tighter (slower), which compounds.
//
// One of the 30-cell pregame audio matrix (3 positions × 10 adversities).
// Generated 2026-05-27 from the locked Forward + Defense + Goalie pilot
// templates. Segments 1-3 and 8-9 are universal lift; segments 4-6 are
// position-specific lift from the defense pilot; segment 7 is
// cell-specific.
//
// Instruction blocks now import from the shared ./instructions.ts module.
// Position segments 4-6 are still lifted from the position pilot — a future
// extraction to per-position segment modules.
