// Goalie × We give up the first goal
//
// First goal against on the goalie is the hardest version of this adversity — the body wants to over-commit on the next shot to make up for it, which opens up rebounds and second chances.
//
// One of the 30-cell pregame audio matrix (3 positions × 10 adversities).
// Generated 2026-05-27 from the locked Forward + Defense + Goalie pilot
// templates. Segments 1-3 and 8-9 are universal lift; segments 4-6 are
// position-specific lift from the goalie pilot; segment 7 is
// cell-specific.
//
// Instruction blocks now import from the shared ./instructions.ts module.
// Position segments 4-6 are still lifted from the position pilot — a future
// extraction to per-position segment modules.
