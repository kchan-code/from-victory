// Defense × I turn the puck over
//
// A D-zone turnover puts the puck behind the goalie's eyes and triggers shame plus the reflex to play tentative on the next breakout.
//
// One of the 30-cell pregame audio matrix (3 positions × 10 adversities).
// Generated 2026-05-27 from the locked Forward + Defense + Goalie pilot
// templates. Segments 1-3 and 8-9 are universal lift; segments 4-6 are
// position-specific lift from the defense pilot; segment 7 is
// cell-specific.
//
// Instruction blocks now import from the shared ./instructions.ts module.
// Position segments 4-6 are still lifted from the position pilot — a future
// extraction to per-position segment modules.
