// Big × Got cooked (switched onto a guard, blown by)
//
// Psychological center: the modern-big switch squeeze — caught on a guard,
// blown by, and the lie is "they'll hunt me every time," so the big stops
// stepping up and the rim goes unprotected (throttled aggression). Tactical
// beat resolves the BIG-distinct way: drop, contain, stay vertical and
// contest at the rim — physical without fouling. FV-29 §4 (Big grid).
// Reuses OPENING/BIG_VIZ/CLOSING.
