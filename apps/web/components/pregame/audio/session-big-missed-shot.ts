// Big × Missed shot
//
// Psychological center: the Big blows a layup / misses the putback /
// bricks the open three and starts believing "I can't even finish at the
// rim" — so the big stops rolling and crashing the glass (throttled
// aggression, the game shrinks). Tactical beat resolves toward re-attacking
// the rim and the offensive glass. FV-29 §4 (Big grid). Reuses
// OPENING/BIG_VIZ/CLOSING.
